# Building the Clock

### In this digital clock, we have hours, minutes, and seconds values that update. Because this is a 12 hour clock, we will include the AM and PM modifier to let us know which half of the two 12 hours in a day we are currently in.

### we should ensure our minutes and seconds values are always two digits in length with a 0 at the beginning if dealing with a single digit value.
